# Swift gRPC API

This directory contains an experimental Swift gRPC API.

Currently not intended for production use, it provides low-level
Swift wrappers for the C gRPC API that can be used to build
higher-level structures supporting streaming and nonstreaming
gRPC APIs. 

The current version contains NO protocol buffer support (yet).
